# Zean's Azure Resume
This Azure Cloud Resume is a static website hosted on an Azure Storage, built with a visitor counter that runs on Azure Functions. The data for the visitor counter is stored and updated through the Azure CosmosDB. The project is also paired with Github for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).

This Project was referenced and guided by Gwyneth Pena-Siguenza.
